## A more complex example

Let's now consider a more complex model that also incorporates some *data science* type elements. Each of the 50 United States has been classified into one of 4 census regions:

![United States Census Regions.](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/images/us_map4.png)

The file `censusRegions.csv` contains a mapping of State abbreviation and its corresponding census region. Consider the following:

```{r}
states <- read.csv("stateCrimeData.csv")
crimedata <- states %>%
  filter(state != "District of Columbia") 

census <- read.csv("censusRegions.csv")
head(census)
names(crimedata)
census <- census %>%
  rename(stabbr = State)
crimedata <- left_join(crimedata, census, by="stabbr")
unique(crimedata$Region)
```

* First, we read in the `stateCrimeData.csv` file from the earlier in-class discussion, and remove the District of Columbia from the data set.  The resulting file we call `crimedata`.
* Then, we read in the `censusRegions.csv` file and note it contains two variables `Region` and `State` (which is really an abbreviation).
* We then look at the variable names in the crime data and note that the state abbreviation variable is called `stabbr`. Ultimately we want to *join* these two datasets together, so we...
* Rename the `State` variable in `census` to `stabbr`. Now our two datasets contain a **common variable** on which to join cases.
* We then *join* the two datasets. Here we use the `left_join` operation so only observations in the `crimedata` are retained (that is, Washington, DC will be dropped since it is not in the crime data).
* Lastly, we look at the `unique` values of the `Region` variable to demonstrate that our joining appears to be successful.

Now let's model Burglary rates as a function of census region:

```{r}
crimefit4 <- lm(Burglary ~ Region, data=crimedata)
summary(crimefit4)
```

*ANSWER THE FOLLOWING* with justification based on the output:

**Question 1**. Does this model predict burglary rates?

*Overall, this model does significantly predict burglary rates ($F$-stat of 11.79 on 3 and 46 degrees of freedom, $p$-value=7.466$10^{-6}$).*

**Question 2**. How much of the variability in burglary rates is explained by census region?

*About 39.78% of the variability in burglary rates is explained by census region.*

**Question 3**. Interpret the `(Intercept)` term in this model.

*The true mean burglary rate for the Midwest Region is 595.68 per 100,000 residents.*

**Question 4**. Interpret the `RegionNortheast` term in this model.

*Being in the Northeast Region is associated with a 130.88 decrease in burglury rates.*

**Question 5**. What do each of the 3 $t$-tests imply?

*Being in the Northeast Region is not a significant predictor for burglary rates ($p$-value of .136).* <br>
*Being in the South Region is a significant predictor for burglary rates ($p$-value of .000124).* <br>
*Being in the West Region is not a significant predictor for burglary rates ($p$-value of .526).*
